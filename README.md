A classic To Do app build with Next.js

The project utilises:
- TypeScript
- styled-components
- client & server architecture, able to be started concurrently using 'npm-concurrently'
- Express server for the todo api (Currently has GET, POST and DELETE endpoints)


To get started, navigate to the client folder from the top-level directory

```
cd client
```
Then simply run dev to concurrently start the client-side app on port 3000 and the server on 3001

```
npm run dev
```
