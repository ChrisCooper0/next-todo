# A Todo app built with Next.js and Express

The project utilises:
- client/server architecture, with a Next.js (React) front-end and Node (Express) back-end
- REST API with GET, POST, PUT & DELETE endpoints
- TypeScript
- styled-components


To get started, navigate to the client folder from the top-level directory:

```
cd client
```
Then run the dev script to concurrently start the client and server apps:

```
npm run dev
```
The client-side React app will open on port 3000 and the Express server on 3001.
