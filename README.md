### A To Do app built with Next.js.

The project utilises:
- client/server architecture, with Next.js (React) serving the front-end and Node (Express) handling the back-end
- REST api for the todos - Currently has GET, POST and DELETE endpoints
- TypeScript
- styled-components


To get started, navigate to the client folder from the top-level directory:

```
cd client
```
Then run the dev script to concurrently start the client and server apps:

```
npm run dev
```
The client-side React app will open on port 3000 and the Express server on 3001.
